hyper
=====

This experimental package is meant to enable composition of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using piped functions. A key consideration is for flexible composability: use HTML-constructing functions, use HTML fragments or Markdown, use R objects or functions to bind data, and also use nested pipelines for less typing.

Installation
------------

You can install hyper from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rich-iannone/hyper")
```
